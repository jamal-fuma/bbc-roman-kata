The problem

We need to write a JavaScript function that converts a number into a Roman Numeral.

function romanNumeralGenerator (int) {

}

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs:

1 = “I”
5 = “V”
10 = “X”
20 = “XX”
3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”

Caveat: Only support numbers between 1 and 3999

For an in-depth description of Roman Numerals, see wikipedia article on Roman_numerals
